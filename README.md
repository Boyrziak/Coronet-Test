# Coronet-Test
Test task for Coronet 
The app is local, so you need to run server with 'node app.js' in the root folder of the project and run the 'index.html' in the src folder.

Backend is only for API purposes, but I can make it whole if needed be. 

The data update on the front page is updated without polling, to match the expectations. User update, add and delete is realized 
via REST. I've made it to illustrate that the project can be easily switched from REST to WebSockets and vice versa in no time.
